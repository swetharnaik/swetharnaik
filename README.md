- 👋 Hi, I’m @swetharnaik
- 👀 I’m interested in upcoming technologies on areas such as cloud computing with sufficient experience in AWS and also on application development mainly Java programming. I have little experience in Big Data technology with Spark on Scala which grew my interest in the tech industry.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning on DevOps mainly Kubernetes, getting some hands on experience in Azure cloud as well as starting to read up on some interesting stuff happening in the ML/AI technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting happening in the tech forum. Would love to contribute on cloud, K8s and application development.
